## Introduction
FlavorSaurus is a cutting-edge AI-powered cooking assistant that suggests food recipes based on your ingredients, allergies, and food preferences. Built using Nvidia NIM endpoints and LangChain, FlavorSaurus is integrated with Pinecone for its vector database and utilizes Gradio for an interactive user interface.

## Features
- Ingredient-Based Recipe Suggestions: Enter the ingredients you have, and FlavorSaurus will suggest recipes you can make with them
- Allergy Consideration: Specify your allergies, and FlavorSaurus will ensure all suggested recipes are safe for you
- Food Preferences: Indicate your dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free) to receive personalized recipe recommendations
- Interactive UI: Use a simple and intuitive interface powered by Gradio to interact with FlavorSaurus

## Technology Stack
- Nvidia NIM Endpoints: For natural language processing and understanding, FlavorSaurus uses 'meta/llama3-8b-instruct' from Nvidia NIM endpoints
- LangChain: Facilitates seamless interaction with the language model
- Embedding model:  FlavorSaurus uses 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' from 'sentence_transformers' library for embedding
- Pinecone: A vector database that enables efficient and scalable storage and retrieval of recipe data
- Gradio: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with FlavorSaurus
